Now that we've had fun with Spark, let's try out Shark. Remember Shark is a large-scale data warehouse system that runs on top of Spark and provides a SQL like interface (that is fully compatible with Apache Hive).

1. First, launch the Shark console:

   <pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
   /home/imdb_1/spark/shark-0.2.1/bin/shark-withinfo
   </pre>

1. Similar to Apache Hive, Shark can query external tables (i.e., tables that are not created in Shark).
   Before you do any querying, you will need to tell Shark where the data is and define its schema.

   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   shark> create external table wikistats (dt string, project_code string, page_name string, page_views int, bytes int) row format delimited fields terminated by ' ' location '/dev/ampcamp/data/wikistats';
   <span class="nocode">
   ...
   Time taken: 0.232 seconds
   13/02/05 21:31:25 INFO CliDriver: Time taken: 0.232 seconds</span></pre>

   <b>FAQ:</b> If you see the following errors, donâ€™t worry. Things are still working under the hood.

   <pre class="nocode">
   12/08/18 21:07:34 ERROR DataNucleus.Plugin: Bundle "org.eclipse.jdt.core" requires "org.eclipse.core.resources" but it cannot be resolved.
   12/08/18 21:07:34 ERROR DataNucleus.Plugin: Bundle "org.eclipse.jdt.core" requires "org.eclipse.core.runtime" but it cannot be resolved.
   12/08/18 21:07:34 ERROR DataNucleus.Plugin: Bundle "org.eclipse.jdt.core" requires "org.eclipse.text" but it cannot be resolved.</pre>

   <b>FAQ:</b> If you see errors like these, you might have copied and pasted a line break, and should be able to remove it to get rid of the errors.

   <pre>13/02/05 21:22:16 INFO parse.ParseDriver: Parsing command: CR
   FAILED: Parse Error: line 1:0 cannot recognize input near 'CR' '&lt;EOF&gt;' '&lt;EOF&gt;'</pre>

1. Let's create a table containing all English records and cache it in the cluster's memory.

   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   shark> create table wikistats_cached as select * from wikistats where project_code="en";
   <span class="nocode">
   ...
   Time taken: 127.5 seconds
   13/02/05 21:57:34 INFO CliDriver: Time taken: 127.5 seconds</span></pre>

1. Do a simple count to get the number of English records. If you have some familiarity working with databases, note that we us the "`count(1)`" syntax here since in earlier versions of Hive, the more popular "`count(*)`" operation was not supported. The Hive syntax is described in detail in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted" target="_blank">Hive Getting Started Guide</a>.

   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   shark> select count(1) from wikistats_cached;
   <span class="nocode">
   ...
   15979408
   Time taken: 7.632 seconds
   12/08/18 21:23:13 INFO CliDriver: Time taken: 7.632 seconds</span></pre>

1. Output the total traffic to Wikipedia English pages for each hour between May 7 and May 9, with one line per hour.

   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   shark> select dt, sum(page_views) from wikistats_cached group by dt;
   <span class="nocode">
   ...
   20090507-070000	6292754
   20090505-120000	7304485
   20090506-110000	6609124
   Time taken: 12.614 seconds
   13/02/05 22:05:18 INFO CliDriver: Time taken: 12.614 seconds</span></pre>

1. In the Spark section, we ran a very expensive query to compute pages that were viewed more than 10,000 times. It is fairly simple to do the same thing in SQL.

   To make the query run faster, we increase the number of reducers used in this query to 30 in the first command. Note that the default number of reducers, which we have been using so far in this section, is 1.

   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   shark> set mapred.reduce.tasks=30;
   shark> select page_name, sum(page_views) as views from wikistats_cached group by page_name having views > 10000;
   <span class="nocode">

1. With all the warm up, now it is your turn to write queries. Write Hive QL queries to answer the following questions:

- Count the number of distinct date/times for English pages

   <div class="solution" markdown="1">
   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   select count(distinct dt) from wikistats_cached;</pre>
   </div>

- How many hits are there on pages with Berkeley in the title throughout the entire period?

   <div class="solution" markdown="1">
   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   select count(page_views) from wikistats_cached where page_name like "%berkeley%";
   /* "%" in SQL is a wildcard matching all characters. */</pre>
   </div>

- Generate a histogram for the number of hits for each hour on May 5, 2009; sort the output by date/time. Based on the output, which hour is Wikipedia most popular?

   <div class="solution" markdown="1">
   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   select dt, sum(page_views) from wikistats_cached where dt like "20090505%" group by dt order by dt;</pre>
   </div>

To exit Shark, type the following at the Shark command line (and don't forget the semicolon!).

   <pre class="prettyprint lang-sql">
   shark> exit;</pre>
