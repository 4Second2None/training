# Getting Started With Your USB Stick

#### On-site Participants
You should have received a USB stick containing the training materials.  If you do not have one, please ask a TA.

If you cannot use the USB stick or would prefer to download an archive with the USB stick's contents,
please click <a href="http://d2xijq8wc2iink.cloudfront.net/ampcamp6/ampcamp6-rc3.tar.gz">here</a>.

#### Remote Participants
Please download the USB stick's contents from
<a href="http://d2xijq8wc2iink.cloudfront.net/ampcamp6/ampcamp6-rc3.tar.gz">here</a>.

## Quick Start

After loading the USB key, you should perform the steps outlined below.  If you
are a windows user, please consider using Powershell, or otherwise replace `cd`
with `dir` and any forward slash (`/`) with a backwards slash (`\`) when
navigating directories.

1. (Recommended, but not required) Copy the contents of the USB drive to somewhere on your hard drive.
It is possible to run the exercises directly from the USB drive, although the exercises will run
much more slowly.

    <p class="alert alert-warn">
    <i class="icon-info-sign">    </i>
    The USB drive contains over 2GB of files, so please begin this file transfer as soon as possible.
    </p>

2. Rename the folder containing all exercise content (either on your hard-drive
   or on the USB key) to `ampcamp6` (or any other pathname without spaces).  If you
   skip this step, you will see your sbt builds fail.

3. Change directories in to the folder containing all exercise content (either on your hard-drive or on the USB key)

    <p class="alert alert-warn">
    <i class="icon-info-sign">    </i>
 Throughout the training exercises, all command-line instructions of the form
 'usb/$' refer to a terminal that is the root directory containing all exercise
 content (either on your hard-drive or on the USB key) . Moreover, [usb root
 directory] refers to the full path to this directory.
    </p>
